Another test of villalba.is. 

It was neccesary becase there is no way [embed-pdf](https://github.com/anvithks/hugo-embed-pdf-shortcode) would work.  

The project is very useful and thanks for all the fish, but it's documentation could be better manteined. This true, say it is a more general way would be: "documentation lacks". That's a universal true.

  Why? Why devs don't go along with writers: because blind people don't like deaf people.
