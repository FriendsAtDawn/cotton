# Cotton

Another test from [villalba.is](https://villalba.is). 

It was needed because sometimes there is no way to get [embed-pdf](https://github.com/anvithks/hugo-embed-pdf-shortcode) to work.  

The project is very useful, and thanks to [anvithks](https://github.com/anvithks) for all the fish, but it's documentation could be better managed. So, to put it in a more general way: "documentation is lacking". That's a generally true statement.

  Why is that? Why developers don't work with writers: because blind people don't like deaf people.
  
  I suppose there's always a doc-dude; but it comes down to -- this sentence is from Zappa -- people who can't write asking people who can't talk to write topics for people who can't read.
